# Developer Mindset
- Break stuff 'til it works
- Google things you aren't sure about
- Break things down into small chunks and get one piece working at a time

### Objectives for your code

- It's pretty predictable (Don't get too fancy unless you have to)
- Future you can read and understand it
- _Other_ developers can read and understand it
- It basically works
