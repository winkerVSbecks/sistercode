# Developer Mindset
- Break stuff 'til it works
- Google things you aren't sure about
- Break things down into small chunks and get one piece working at a time

### Objectives for your code

- It's pretty predictable (Don't get too fancy unless you have to)
- Future you can read and understand it
- _Other_ developers can read and understand it
- It basically works

# Google-Fu
## Cooler than you'd think, less than you'd hope.

--

# Pair Programming
## No-one's as smart as all of us.

# Rubber Duck Debugging
## Bear with me on this one.

--

# You're Not Alone
## And you don't need to do everything yourself.
