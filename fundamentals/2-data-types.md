# Data Types

--

# String
## Used to store data as text. Anything between quotes will be understood as a string
```js
'I am a string.'
"I'm a string, but I need double-quotes or the computer will get confused by the apostrophe"
'5'
```

--

# Number
## Used to store numbers.
```js
4
3.333
```
--

### Array

Used to store a list of data. An array is composed of different types, and can mix and match them. We'll talk more about them later.

- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
```js
[
  'I am a string in an Array',
  2,
  ['I am an array in another array!'],
]
```

--

# Boolean
##Always stores either `true` or `false`. That's it!!

```js
true
false
```
--

# Undefined
## This means that no data or data type has been defined yet. You'll see this in the dev tools console sometimes.

```js
console.log('The console is silly sometimes');
=> undefined
```

--

# Other Types
- Objects
- Null

--

# Operations
## An operation is a calculation. Similar to math, different data types can do different operations

--

# NaN
## "Not a Number" - the computer couldn't figure out what you were doing

--

# Computers are dumb
## JavaScript will try its best to figure out what you mean, but it's best if it doesn't have to guess
